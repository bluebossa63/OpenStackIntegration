h1. Important

You will need the sources from https://github.com/bluebossa63/openstack-java-sdk

openstack-client
keystone-client

swift-client
swift-model

were either added as eclipse projects by eclipse build path (with export) or generated by maven project import:

h2. Manual setup of the eclipse project

!/docs/eclipse1.png?raw=true!

That's how it looks in my workspace...
As you can see, I have all the projects checked out in the workspace and you see the template.classpath and the template project.

You can try to close the project and use the to files as .project and .classpath or you set it up manually:

!/docs/eclipse2.png?raw=true!

Add projects...

!/docs/eclipse3.png?raw=true!

check the exports:

!/docs/eclipse4.png?raw=true!

And just in case to be sure: try to start an emulator without any code.

I tested it on 4.4.

!/docs/eclipse5.png?raw=true!


I recommend http://www.genymotion.com/ (thanks, Frédéric!) as the emulator that comes with the android sdk is much to slow!

On setting up the project please refer to

https://github.com/bluebossa63/OpenStackIntegration/issues/1

and do not hesitate to add your own questions! 

Documentation is something leaving always a lot of room for improvement!
